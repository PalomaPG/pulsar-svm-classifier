# pulsar-svm-classifier

## Requirements:

    Programming language: Python 3.6

    Libraries:
        - matplotlib
        - numpy
        - sys

## Execution

    In a terminal, just tape

    python tarea2.py <data_file_path>


    Where <data_file_path> is the complete path to HTRU_2.csv file.

    Note, if python 3.6 isn't your default python version in your OS, but a 2.x version is
    and you have python 3.6 already installed, just run

    python3 tarea2.py <data_file_path>

## Outputs

This program generates nine images four of these correspond to ROC curves plotting (by kernel or 'solo' plots,
and all three classifiers), and the rest correspond to cross validation results (depicted on the report).
